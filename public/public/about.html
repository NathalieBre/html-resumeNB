<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nathalie Breuninger and I am a web developer since 2024. </p>

<p>During my Apprenticeship as an office administrator between 2017 and 2019 I discovered that I like working independently on projects on a computer. I particularly enjoyed working with excel for a long time, but also enjoyed working with word. </p>

<p>In my studies in educational science I found my passion in social work and administration. But my interest in web development work never stopped, so I started to educate myself in front-end and back-end. Finally in 2024 I started a full web develompent course and finished it in 2025.   .</p>

<p> I work responsibly, reliably and creatively. I like challenges and am constantly upgrading my skills. I speak German, French and English fluently and have basic knowledge of Spanish. Besides working as a web developer, I am a social worker. In my free time I like to go travelling, bouldering or play the piano.  </p>
